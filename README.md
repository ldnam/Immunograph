# Immunograph

The project is part of the internship at the Ritchie Lab of the University of Pennsylvania. In this project, I did some literature summaries regarding the existing
methods to create a biomedical knowledge graph. Besides, I used Neo4j to re-generate the graph and run graph algorithms including Louvain and Leiden methods.

The project aims to explore the connections between different elements in the graph such as antigens, proteins, ... The results show a mutual relation between these characters. The presentation link to the results is [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFHyFJu8Cw/BfB7y9IsntcR1QydShLcjQ/edit?utm_content=DAFHyFJu8Cw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
