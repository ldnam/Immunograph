This priming step can result from TLR signaling, which may help ensure that inflammasome activation proceeds primarily during infections...  Several other NLR family members form inflammasomes with ASC and caspase 1 that activate these pro-inflammatory cytokines. NLRP1 is highly expressed in monocytes and dendritic cells and is activated directly by MDP, similar to NOD2, but can also be activated by other factors. For example, Bacillus anthracis expresses an endopeptidase, called anthrax lethal factor, which allows the pathogen to evade the immune system by killing macrophages. Lethal factor does this by cleaving NLRP1, activating an NLRP1 inflammasome and inducing pyroptosis in the infected macrophages.

In the elicitation phase, a subsequent exposure to the sensitizing chemical leads to antigen presentation to memory T cells in the dermis, with the release of T-cell cytokines such as IFN-? and IL-17. This stimulates the keratinocytes of the epidermis to release IL-1, IL-6, TNF-à, GM-CSF, the chemokine CXCL8, and the interferon-inducible chemokines CXCL11 (IP-9), CXCL10 (IP-10), and CXCL9 (Mig, a monokine induced by IFN-?).

When NOD1 or NOD2 recognizes its ligand, it recruits the CARD-containing serine?threonine kinase RIP2 (also known as RICK and RIPK2) (see Fig. 3.17). RIP2 associates with the E3 ligases cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP, whose activity generates a polyubiquitin scafold as in TLR signaling. This scafold recruits TAK1 and IKK and results in activation of NF?B as shown in Fig. 3.15. NF?B then induces the expression of genes for inflammatory cytokines and for enzymes involved in the production of nitric oxide (NO), which is toxic to bacteria and intracellular parasites. In keeping with their role as sensors of bacterial components, NOD proteins are expressed in cells that are routinely exposed to bacteria. These include epithelial cells forming the barrier that bacteria must cross to establish an infection in the body, and the macrophages and dendritic cells that ingest bacteria that have succeeded in entering the body.",Epithelial_barrier,,,NO,,,,Secrete,,Antibacterial,,,,,,

TH2 cells themselves secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, thus maintaining an environment in which further differentiation of TH2 cells is favored.

TLR-7 and TLR-9 are expressed by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, B cells, and eosinophils; TLR-8 is expressed primarily by monocytes and macrophages. TLR-7 and TLR-8 are activated by single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), which is a component of healthy mammalian cells, but it is normally confined to the nucleus and cytoplasm and is not present in endosomes... TLR-9 recognizes unmethylated CpG dinucleotides. In mammalian genomes, CpG dinucleotides in genomic DNA are heavily methylated on the cytosine by DNA methyltransferases.
